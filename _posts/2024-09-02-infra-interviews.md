As a Software Engineer who's *in the weeds* with a lot of the new content creators spinning up in the wild, it's interesting to see their takes on the Software Engineering Interview. Regarded to some the *root of all evil* and *a Leetcoder's Playground*, it's the gateway between a technically rewarding career with excellence at the forefront and one that is not nearly as lavish.

There seems to be an insane amount of "hype"" for the technical interview, with other pieces of content following the same trend: career advice from those with a traditional path to Big N. For one thing, more representation and insights from those who have had or currently have unorthodox career journeys would be more beneficial.

Yes, there are lots of flaws.

Yes, things are changing.

Yes, they are still difficult.

But this post won't go over any SWE-Style Technical Interviews, namely because I haven't been in a respected circuit to give enough information about it. There are truly *no bounds* to the information you can get online about Leetcode style interviews.

I want to talk a bit about interviews pertaining to the following archetypes:

* Infrastructure Engineer
* DevOps Engineer
* Software Engineer, Infra
* Platform Engineer
* Reliability Engineer
